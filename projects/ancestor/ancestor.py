1. Translate the problem into graph terminology:
vertex = Individual
edges = relationship from one individual to another individual, in this case one directional and = parent. 
weights = None needed

2. build your graph: child: {parent pairs}
{   
    11: {}
    10 : {},
    9 : {8},
    8 : {4,11},
    7 :{5},
    6: {3,5},
    5: {4},
    4: {},
    3: {1,2},
    2: {},
    1: {10}
}

3. Traverse your graph:
BFT will work.  Can start from any vertex.
 -return the earliest known ancestor
 - If there is more than one ancestor tied to “earliest”, return the one with the lowest 
 numeric ID.
 -If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1.
